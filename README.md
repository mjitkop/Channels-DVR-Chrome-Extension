# Channels-DVR-Chrome-Extension
Enhance your Channels DVR experience — no setup required.
This extension brings powerful enhancements directly to the Channels DVR web interface, making advanced tools accessible to everyone.

At launch, it introduces a long-requested feature: manual recording creation. Previously, this required separate apps, Docker containers, or Python scripts. Now, it runs seamlessly in your browser — no installations, no technical hurdles.

Just plug and play.
More features are planned for future updates, all designed to integrate smoothly into the interface you already use.

"Mark As Not Recorded" is available in the options menu of recorded programs in:
 - DVR > Manage > Shows
 - DVR > Manage > Movies
 - Library > TV Shows

It only works on recorded programs. In other words, it won't work on imported videos, stream links and stream files.
