# Channels-DVR-Chrome-Extension
Enhance your Channels DVR experience — no setup required.
This extension brings powerful enhancements directly to the Channels DVR web interface, making advanced tools accessible to everyone.

At launch, it introduces a long-requested feature: manual recording creation. Previously, this required separate apps, Docker containers, or Python scripts. Now, it runs seamlessly in your browser — no installations, no technical hurdles.

Just plug and play.
More features are planned for future updates, all designed to integrate smoothly into the interface you already use.
